# 🧠 Mr. Bas – AI Portfolio

Welcome! This site documents my personal journey into Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning.

## 👨‍💻 Background

Currently working as a Java Developer specialized in test automation, with a strong focus on software quality and continuous integration. In parallel, I'm diving deep into the world of AI — exploring modern tools like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn to build intelligent systems.
